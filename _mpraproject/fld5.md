description: "A softball tournament hosted by the Torres family for three generations
  in Maui brought out scores of players, not all Puerto Ricans, from across the islands
  of Hawaii. The teams included an open league, senior league, and a men's and women's
  league. For three days, and across three fields the teams faced double elimination
  rounds to decide the winners. These pictures were probably from the last year the
  family held the tournament. The family remains in Maui today. \r\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\r\n\r\r\r\r\nIn
  the photos we see: Kristy Haleiakala and brother Blasie Statas keeping score. "
