description: "From 1980 to 2019, MPRA participated in the Maui County Fair as a vendor
  selling Puerto Rican food (pasteles, rice, beans, empanadillas). The fair was the
  associations most important annual fundraiser, raising upwards to $30K, and required
  everyone's participation in food preparation and serving. The fair also featured
  a parade that was attended by another 3-4000 people, and each organization designed
  and built their own float. \r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nIncluded

ethnographic_note: "The Maui County Fair permanently ended in 2019 after a 97 year
  run. Considered the longest running and largest fair in Hawaii, the fair first started
  in 1916 and by its last year attracted upwards to 150,000. The closure of the fair
  has caused a financial windfall for many community organizations, including MPRA.

  of these photos are from the 1997 fair. "
