Welcome to the Maui Puerto Rican Association digital archive. We are slowly developing this archive within our collective to document as many names and event details while our founding members remain with us. We welcome contributions from any Puerto Rican in Maui.  

We have set up the search functions for filtering within tags, object types, locations, and authors. Many of the items have multiple tags in the data set. Additionally, there is a unique category called ethnographic notes where observations, additional detail, and direct quotes are included.
